  # Application framework: Intent. Extend the application of part (2) to two activities, and then use Intent to communicate between these two activities.
  Add a button "change picture" in your layout. When this button is pressed, it activates the second activity. In the second activity, allow the user to choose a picture from a set of pictures. When the user presses the button "pick" in this second activity, it returns the chosen picture to the first activity which in turn displays the returned picture.
