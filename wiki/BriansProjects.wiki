=Brian's Projects=

Here are projects I completed in [http://cadlab.ece.ucsb.edu/ece194/ ECE194] (Winter 2011)

==Homework 1: Photo Switcher==
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJjEvwy8yDc YouTube Demonstration]

  # Write an application to display your name and photo. Run this application either on the emulator or an Android device.
  # Application framework: Intent. Extend the application of part (2) to two activities, and then use Intent to communicate between these two activities.
  Add a button "change picture" in your layout. When this button is pressed, it activates the second activity. In the second activity, allow the user to choose a picture from a set of pictures. When the user presses the button "pick" in this second activity, it returns the chosen picture to the first activity which in turn displays the returned picture.

==Homework 2: Lunar Lander==
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPiuvESpVaA YouTube Demonstration]

  # Extend the Lunar Lander application to respond to the device's orientation. Create asteroids and a landing pad. Navigate through the asteroids and land the lunar lander safely. Missing the landing pad or hitting an asteroid results in a crash. In addition, implement:
    * Tap to start
    * Shake to restart
    * Tilt to control

==Homework 3: JNI and OpenGL==
  * In progress
